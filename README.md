# FlashFloppy-OSD-Adapter
 Adapter which should make it a little easier to handle the bluepill for regular GOTEK drives for the Amiga
 
# What is it?
It's just a basic adapter which draws out the pins needed to connect the bluepill with the Amiga and GOTEK drive.
You can also program the Bluepill using this adapter. 
 
# How to use
Download the gerber (zip) file and upload it to your favorite PCB manufacturer. I'm using jlcpcb.com.

You decide if you want to use sil headers or just solder wires to the holes.
If you have a 3D Printet drive bay, you can attach the Adapter with Bluepill to here.

# Do I really need this?
No, you can use the Bluepill without this adapter.

# More?
You can isolate the bottom to prevent accidently shorts.
