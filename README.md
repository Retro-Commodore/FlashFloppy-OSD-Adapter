# FlashFloppy-OSD-Adapter
 Adapter which should make it a little easier to handle the bluepill for regular GOTEK drives for the Amiga
 
# What is it?
It's just a basic adapter which draws out the pins needed to connect the bluepill with the Amiga and GOTEK drive.
You can also program the Bluepill using this adapter. 
 
# How to use
Download the gerber (zip) file and upload it to your favorite PCB manufacturer. I'm using jlcpcb.com.

Go to https://github.com/keirf/FF_OSD 

You decide if you want to use sil headers or just solder wires to the holes.
If you have a 3D Printet drive bay, you can attach the Adapter with Bluepill to here.

# Do I really need this?
No, you can use the Bluepill without this adapter.

# More?
You can isolate the bottom to prevent accidently shorts.
